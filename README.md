# 🤖 AI-Powered Data Science Tutor

## 🚀 Overview
The **AI-Powered Data Science Tutor** is a conversational AI application built using **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, LangChain, and Streamlit**. It is designed to answer data science-related queries, explain concepts, and provide Python implementations where applicable.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Answer data science-related questions
- 🐍 Provide Python code snippets for implementation
- 🧠 Maintain conversation context with memory (planned improvement)
- 🎨 Simple and interactive UI using Streamlit

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python** - Core programming language
- 🤖 **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** - AI model for generating responses
- 🔗 **LangChain** - Managing AI interactions and memory (future enhancement)
- 🎨 **Streamlit** - Frontend UI for interaction

## 📥 Installation
### ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.10+** installed on your system.

### 📌 Steps to Install & Run
1. 📂 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-ds-tutor.git
   cd ai-ds-tutor
   ```
2. 🔧 Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. 📦 Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. 🔑 Set up your **Google Gemini API key** (replace with your actual key):
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # On Windows use `set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
   ```
5. ▶️ Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🎯 Usage
1. ✍️ Enter your data science-related question in the text area.
2. 🎯 Click the **Submit** button.
3. ⏳ Wait for the AI to process and respond.
4. 📜 Read the response and, if applicable, use the provided Python code snippet.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🧠 Implement **memory** using LangChain for a more interactive experience
- 🎙️ Add **voice input** support
- 🛡️ Improve **error handling** and **response accuracy**
- 🌍 Deploy as a web app for public access
